This file contains information about the JHU-CROWD++ (v2.0) dataset. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JHU-CROWD++ is a comprehensive dataset with 4,372 images and 1.51 million annotations. In comparison 
to existing datasets, the proposed dataset is collected under a variety of diverse scenarios and 
environmental conditions. In addition, the dataset provides comparatively richer set of annotations 
like dots, approximate bounding boxes, blur levels, etc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIRECTORY INFO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The dataset directory contains 3 sub-directories: train, val and test.

2. Each of these contain 2 sub-directories (images, gt) and a file "image_labels.txt".

3. The "images" directory contains images and the "gt" directory contains ground-truth files 
   corresponding to the images in the images directory.

4. The number of samples in train, val and test split are 2272, 500, 1600 respectively.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GROUND-TRUTH ANNOTATIONS: "HEAD-LEVEL"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Each ground-truth file in the "gt" directory contains "space" separated values with each row 
   inidacting x,y,w,h,o,b 

2. x,y indicate the head location.

3. w,h indicate approximate width and height of the head.

4. o indicates occlusion-level and it can take 3 possible values: 1,2,3. 
   o=1 indicates "visible"
   o=2 indicates "partial-occlusion"
   o=3 indicates "full-occlusion"
   
5. b indicates blur-level and it can take 2 possible values: 0,1. 
   b=0 indicates no-blur 
   b=1 indicates blur
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GROUND-TRUTH ANNOTATIONS: "IMAGE-LEVEL"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Each split in the dataset contains a file "image_labels.txt". This file contains image-level labels.

2. The values in the file are comma separated and each row indicates: 
	"filename, total-count, scene-type, weather-condition, distractor"
	
3. total-count indicates the total number of people in the image

4. scene-type is an image-level label describing the scene

5. weather-condition indicates the weather-degradation in the image and can take 4 values: 0,1,2,3
   weather-condition=0 indicates "no weather degradation"
   weather-condition=1 indicates "fog/haze"
   weather-condition=2 indicates "rain"
   weather-condition=3 indicates "snow"
   
6. distractor indicates if the image is a distractor. It can take 2 values: 0,1
   distractor=0 indicates "not a distractor"
   distractor=1 indicates "distractor"
